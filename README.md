# Intern Bot

The *Unpaid Replit Internâ„¢* is a Discord Bot that helps me manage and execute events in the Replit Discord Server. Left open source for people to take a peek behind the scenes. 

I've written this specifically for use within the Replit server, and I'm the only active maintainer. What I'm trying to say is that there aren't any comments nor is the code very intuitive so adapt it at your own displeasure :)
