Welcome to the Replit Help Hub, where you can find help with your various questions, and share your knowledge with others! We have three different areas of help requests.

üí≥ **Code Help~~** <#437062563620978708>
Here you can ask for help with coding problems, bugs, and general questions.

üñ•Ô∏è **Replit Help~~** <#903018192962748456>
Here you can ask for help with how to use Replit, and any problems you might run into using the service.

ü§ñ **Bot Help~~** <#903018261682212924>
This is similar to *Code Help*, but is specific to asking for help with developing Discord bots or interacting the Discord API with various frameworks, like `discord.py` or `discord.js`.

**Rules and Etiquette~~**

‚úß Please, please, please make sure to Google your questions before asking in chat.
‚úß Don‚Äôt ask to ask - the channel category is labelled help, we know what you‚Äôre here for.
‚úß If you are pinging multiple help roles, do it in one message so as not to double ping those with overlapping roles.
‚úß Be wary of the X/Y problem, please state your problems, not your intended solutions.
‚úß If you're struggling with a specific problem, post your code and any errors!

**Requesting Help~~**
